Question 1
"When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?"
—————

Using a remote repository allows me to access it whenever I am, instead of relying on a specific computer HDD.




Question 2
"Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?"
—————

You don't want to Git update every-minor-change and also, there are things you don't want to go public yet.




Question 3
"Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?"
—————

Forks are GitHub repositories clones (with internal pointers and markers), clones are simple copies of GitHub repositories (with no internal links between them) and branches are timelines of a repository (either local, or on GitHub).
You use forks when you want to credit the original coder, when you want to mess around with that code yourself and want to be able to contribute with it.
On the other hand, cloning is a command you use when you want to make a simple copy of a repository and its commit history - without any internal links and credits to the original repository.
And lastly a branch is a timeline of a code's history. All the changes that were done in a timeline, grouped as a tree branch.



Question 4
"What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?"
—————

When merging with a colaborator, your code can be compared to it and to the colaborator's. And changed/merged accordingly.



Question 5
"How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?"
