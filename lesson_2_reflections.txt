Question 1
"What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?"
—————

Whn you initialize a repository based on an existing directory, Git creates an  invisible meta file .git inside this folder to track the directory you were in when you gave the <<git init>> command.
I've done it so now the directory *is* a proper repository and can be version-controlled by Git.



Question 2
"How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?"
—————

Staging area seems like a intermediary limbo where stuff are prepared to get commited. Different from the working directory, the staging area is being watched by Git.
The staging area has the same value as an e-mail draft - a place where you can put stuff before commiting it definitely.
