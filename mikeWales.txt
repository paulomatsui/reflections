Hi, my name is Mike Wales, and I’m a manager.

I usually create a new branch whenever I’m moving on to a different piece of work. Anytime I’m doing something different, I will create a new branch.

I’d like to think it as context switching. Whenever I’m switching toward work a new feature, or whether I’m going to correct a bug, I’ll create a new branch at that time.

Git Branches help you keep a project organized, particulary when you’re sharing that project publicly(?).
You have your master branch and that would be your production quality branch - that never breaks, always works - and then you could have a development branch where actual work is taken place on your project.

Then a lot of time you’ll have things like experimental branch, or maybe some unique feature branches. Those are things that you are working on and you’re fully expect them to break.
And you want to share those with the public, but with the understanding that this isn’t production quality work just yet.

Branches are also good when not only colaborating publicly but really good colaborate with yourself. So lot of times, if I’m working on a feature and I come across a bug, branches allow me that ability to context switch and get away from the work I’m doing on my feature, go back to where I need to be to fix the bug and then compartmentalize that work.

Branches are really good even if I get bored on working on a feature. It gives me the ability to “Ok, I wanna switch and star working on something else right now.”
